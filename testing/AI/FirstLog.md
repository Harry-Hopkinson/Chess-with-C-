The AI works flawlessly - I have played it on all of the levels and it works seamlessly.

There are Five Depths - Beginner (1), Easy (2), Medium (3), Hard(4) and Insane(5):

    Beginner is extremely easy to beat and never sees the best moves while hanging pieces - the AI is working really well at managing to play the worst moves.

    Easy is a challenge for beginners but for intermediates or advance players a piece of cake - they fall for easy tactics and blunders pieces - plays some okay moves.

    Medium puts you into check and can put some pressure onto you - if you know how to defend or trade you can win easily - they fall for a trick where you pin their rooks in the corner.

    Hard is a challenge for intermediate players as it knows tactics and goes for checkmates and captures. A challenge for intermediate players.

    Insane is a difficult challenge for advanced and intermediate players - the depth is too high and the computer thinks for minutes just for the opening move - may incoperate a different engine so the moves can be calculated quicker.
